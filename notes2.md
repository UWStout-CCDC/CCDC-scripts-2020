Checking for LastLogon, FailedLogonAttempts

- PowerShell on Windows
- TripWire: We are using aide - we should create a filter + wall for it
- Avast for Windows
- ClamAV for Linux

- Netstat + checking against initial list
  (See if we can set up some kind of filter for this?)

- Can pcap send packets after

- Check for changes (ideally with package manager against repos)
